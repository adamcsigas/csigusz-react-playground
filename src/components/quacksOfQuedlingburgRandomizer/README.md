## The reason behind this project
Quacks of Quedlinburg is a board game with a lengthy setup process. This randomizer aims to reduce setup time
by generating a random selection of books, patients, and witches based on the extensions you own or want to 
include in the next game.

## Status of the project

2023.04.09: (project starting date)
- Some basic README documentation has been written.

2023.04.10:
- I created a randomizer button and some basic UI which will generate a random set of books. 
However, this implementation does not yet take into consideration certain aspects of the setup process,
such as owned extensions of the game.

## Features
- `Selection`: Choose which expansions to include in the randomizer.
- `Randomizer`: Click the button to generate a set of books, patients, and witches for your next game based on 
your selected expansions.
